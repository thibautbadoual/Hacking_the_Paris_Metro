    Because of multithreading / multiprocessing semantics, Queue.qsize() may
    raise the NotImplementedError exception on Unix platforms like Mac OS X
    where sem_getvalue() is not implemented. This subclass addresses this
    problem by using a synchronized shared counter (initialized to zero) and
    increasing / decreasing its value every time the put() and get() methods
    are called, respectively. This not only prevents NotImplementedError from
    being raised, but also allows us to implement a reliable version of both
    qsize() and empty().
